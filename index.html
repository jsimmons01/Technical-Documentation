        <p>
          In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!

        <h1>What is HTML</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element" target="_blank">elements</a>, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag">tags</a> can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:
      </p> 
        <pre> My cat is very grumpy </pre>
        <p> If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element:</p>
        <pre> 
          &lt;p&gt;My Cat is very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;     
        </pre>
        
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
      <header>
        <h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:
        </p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="HTML element">
        <p>
        The main parts of our element are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
          <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
          <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
          <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
          <li><b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
        </p>
        <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="attributes in an element">
        <p>
          Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute <em>name</em> and <code>editor-note</code> is the attribute <em>value</em>. The <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style information and other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          An attribute should always have the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
          <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="special-note">
        Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters <code>"</code><code>'</code><code>`</code><code>=</code><code>&lt;</code><code>&gt;</code> ) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.
        </p>
        <h2>Nesting elements</h2>
        <p>
          Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called <stong>nesting</stong>. If we wanted to state that our cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code> &lt;strong&gt; </code> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
        </p> 
        <pre>

          &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;grumpy.&lt;/p&gt; 
        </pre>     
        <p>
          There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <code>p</code> element first, then opened the <code>strong</code> element. For proper nesting, we should close the <code>strong</code> element first, before closing the <code>p</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following is an example of the <em>wrong way</em> to do nesting:
        </p>
        <pre id="wrong-code">

          &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
        </p>
          <h2>Empty elements</h2>
          <p>
          Some elements have no content and are called <strong>empty elements</strong>. Take the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element that we already have in our HTML page:
          </p>
          <pre>
            
            &lt;img src=&quotimages/firefox-icon.png&quot&gt; alt=&quotMy test image&quot
          </pre>
          <p>
          This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
          </p>
          </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Images">
    <header>
    <h1>Images</h1> 
    </header>
    <p>
      Let's turn our attention to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <pre>
      
      &lt;img src=&quotimages/firefox-icon.png&quot&gt; alt=&quotMy test image&quot
    </pre>
    <p>
    As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the <code>src</code> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
      <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
    </ol> 
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png" alt="alt text example">
    <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>
    <p>
    Try coming up with some better alt text for your image now.

      <h1>Marking up text</h1> 
      </header>
      <article>
      <p>
        This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.
      </p> 
      <h2>
        Headings
      </h2>
      <p>
      Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
      </p>
      <pre>

        &lt;h1&gt;62My main title&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;My sub-heading&lt;/h4&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now try adding a suitable title to your HTML page just above your <code>img</code> element. 
      </p>
      <p class="special-note">
        Note: You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading elements to make text bigger or bold, because they are used for <a hrfe="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#text_content" target="_blank">accessibility</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#why_do_we_need_structure" target="_blank">other reasons such as SEO</a>. Try to create a meaningful sequence of headings on your pages, without skipping levels.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Paragraphs
      </h2>
      <p>
        As explained above, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content: 
      </p>
      <pre>

        &lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
      </pre>
        Add your sample text (you should have it from (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like" target="_blank">What will you website look like</a>) into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. 
      </code>
      <h2>
        Lists
      </h2>
      <p>
        A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> element.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Each item inside the lists is put inside an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> (list item) element.
      </p>
      <p>
      For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list 
      </p>
      <pre>
        
        &lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, wepre a lobal community of &lt;p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;techonologists&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;    

        &lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, wepre a lobal community of &lt;p&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
        Try adding an ordered or unordered list to your example page.
      </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Links">
      <header>
        <h1>
        Links
      </h1>
      </header>
      
      <p>
        Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
        Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto". 
        </li>
        <li>
          Wrap the text in an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, as shown below:
          <code>
            &lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Give the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element an <code>href</code> attribute, as shown below:
          <code>
            &lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
        Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:
          <code>
            &lt;a&gt; href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;
          </code>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You might get unexpected results if you omit the <code>https:/</code>/ or <code>http://</code> part, called the <em>protocol</em>, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to. 
      </p>
      <p class="special-note">
        <code>href</code> might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are having trouble remembering it, remeber that it stands for <strong>h</strong>ypertext <strong>ref</strong>erence. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a link to your page now, it you haven't already done so.
